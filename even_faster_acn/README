tried to make sure everything is created and stored on device, large full batch distance calc rather than loops

This version is even faster than the one in ../acn, using a cached partial gram matrix calc. See code comments in "kneighbors" function for details,
or https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~albanie/notes/Euclidean_distance_trick.pdf . It may not be faster in every scenario, so I figured having implementations of each would be useful
